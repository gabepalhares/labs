## PodBits

This is a personal project maintained by me, and much like "all roads lead to Rome," everything related to it involves my learning and the implementation of ideas and new tools.

The idea for PodBits arose after a conversation with [Sibelius](https://x.com/sseraphini), where I was explaining the process of creating one of my articles. This article was related to a tech talk he had presented, and one of its goals was to preserve some of that knowledge. In the article, I highlighted one of the sections that had a significant impact on me, and when I shared this with him, the question arose: **"Why not create TL;DRs for Tech Talks and Podcasts?"**

#### Too Long, Didn't Read became Too Long, Didn't Listen.

This was the starting point for PodBits, which became a way to store podcast and tech talk content in a quick and summarized format, providing a new alternative for consuming tech content. Why spend 50 minutes listening to a podcast when you can consume that content in less than 10 minutes of reading? Last but not least, it also became a way to publicly share what I’m learning.

I decided to use `Astro.js` primarily because, when it comes to reading format consumption, nothing beats a blog. Given that I see Astro as the best option for building blogs, the choice was straightforward. Additionally, Astro’s documentation is exceptionally well-crafted, concise, simple, and practical. Therefore, PodBits is a web page with the structure of a blog, making it not only practical and accessible but also easy to maintain.

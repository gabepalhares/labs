#### Happiness is only real when shared.

"Memoria" is a word of Latin origin that translates to "memory" in English. It refers to the faculty of the mind by which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved. It can also signify the act of remembering or something that is remembered, such as an event, experience, or moment.

In a broader sense, "memoria" can symbolize the preservation of moments, thoughts, or stories, making it the perfect term for an ambience focused on capturing and sharing meaningful experiences.

Although I left Instagram, I still had a desire to have a place where I could share the special moments of my life, like a life album that I could revisit over the years.

From this feeling, the motivation to create this project emerged. I hope this idea can also inspire other developers or people who enjoy creating their own sanctuaries on the internet.

It has become a project more focused on touching this side of the soul than merely showcasing technical knowledge, so please feel comfortable with its simplicity.

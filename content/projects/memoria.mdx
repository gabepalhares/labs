#### Happiness is only real when shared.

"Memoria" is a word of Latin origin that translates to "memory" in English. It refers to the faculty of the mind by which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved. It can also mean the act of remembering or something that is remembered, such as events, experiences, moments, or feelings.

Although I left Instagram, I still had a desire to have a place where I could share the special moments of my life, like a life album that I could revisit over the years. From this feeling, the motivation to create this project emerged. I hope this idea can also inspire other developers or people who enjoy creating their own places on the internet.

It was built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Cloudinary, and Vercel hosting.

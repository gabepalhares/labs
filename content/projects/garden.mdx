**g.arden** is a project inspired by two amazing people: [Sibelius](https://x.com/sseraphini) and [Biantris](https://x.com/biantris_).

It was created to serve as a Zettelkasten learning base, where I share my ideas and what I’m learning, like a deep dive into my mind. It is also a 'docs version' of my software engineering path.

The project is mainly built with `Docusaurus` — ironically, just like many documentations around the internet — along with `TypeScript` and `JavaScript`.
